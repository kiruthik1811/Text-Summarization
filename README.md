Text Summarization Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements Text Summarization using both Extractive and Abstractive approaches. It leverages LexRank for extractive summarization and BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn) for abstractive summarization. The aim is to generate concise summaries while preserving the key meaning of the original text.

ðŸš€ Features
Extractive Summarization using sumy (LexRank algorithm).

Abstractive Summarization using Hugging Face Transformers (BART model).
