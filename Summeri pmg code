Extractive Summary:
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

Your max_length is set to 130, but your input_length is only 112. Since this is a summarization task, where outputs shorter than the input are typically wanted, you might consider decreasing max_length manually, e.g. summarizer('...', max_length=56)

Abstractive Summary:
 Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind.
